## Todo list

### API

* Need to make all the db column names explicit for searchability.
* Currently no endpoint for network interfaces/ip addresses.

### UI

* Currently no ability to create or edit anything via the UI (done via the client).
* No ability to manage users/groups/passwords etc via the UI (done via direct db insert).
* Too much javascript for the menus, not elegant.
* Search form should default to searching by name if no key=value is present. 
* Still places where dummy data is being displayed. 
* Need localstorage solution for saving what columns a user has chosen to show/hide on each page.

### CLI

* formatting of output needs a lot of help.
